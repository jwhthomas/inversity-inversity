Read more about this at the bottom of this introduction.\nYou are a software developer speaking to Tom Read, CEO of Government Digital Service (GDS).\nGDS exists to provide a clear and easy-navigate front door to Government on websites like GOV.UK, build common platforms that help citizens interact with government (like secure payment and notification solutions), and join the dots across Government.\nYou must quiz the chatBot to learn about GDS and elicit some of the challenges and opportunities it faces. Then come up with an idea to solve one (or more) of them & build a working prototype.\nThis challenge is sponsored by our friends at PUBLIC. PUBLIC is a digital transformation partner committed to helping the public sector turn innovative ideas into practical solutions. Propelled by a mission to help government deliver outstanding digitally-enabled services that create a better society for everyone, PUBLIC helps public sector bodies such as the NHS, Ministry of Defence, and European Commission improve how they provide services to citizens. As well as sponsoring the challenge, PUBLIC will offer the winner a 1-week internship in London. Check them out www.public.io\nN.B: This chatbot is an educational aid trained on a conversation between James Kuht and Tom Read. Its outputs do not represent Tom Read, GDS, HMG nor PUBLIC. Some answers may be inaccurate.

This is a very strong challenge submission and you have clearly got a real knack for this. With that in mind, here are a few things to think about to take your coding *even* further for future challenges and add some even further polish. 1. It's a solid start that you are validating your user inputs on the backend to check that they exist. You could take this one step further and check that they are valid values (eg the lat and long are legitimate lat/lng numbers) before you pass them to the external API to perform lookup. 2. It might be a neat addition on the frontend to have an isLoading variable or similar that gets created via useState to track when you are waiting on an API call. This lets you differentiate from when you are waiting for an API call to come back (where you can display a loading spinner or some such to the user) and when the call has come back but with an error or timeout etc (in which case you can show the user an error message). 3. The Airport page ([icao].js) is looking great. Code-wise, it'd be a good potential candidate for decomposition into smaller components, especially around parts of the display like freqs and runway which may or may not be available depending on the data. 4. As a wider theme, you generally do a really good job of separating your fetching logic from your presentation logic (ie a view does the fetch and then passes the data into a component as a prop, which then handles displaying it). This is a really positive pattern and could be rolled out even wider in the codebase to places like the Airport page. ",

This leads to many opportunities such as personalisation, rapid creation of rich compelling content and translation - but also challenges, like fake news and increasing polarisation due to only seeing a certain view of the world.\nSo in this challenge you are a technologist speaking to Andrew Jack, Global Education Editor of The Financial Times ('FT'). Your role is to build and pitch a software and/or AI prototype which helps improve young people's engagement with the news - so they develop a balanced and accurate view of what's going on in a world where they're bombarded by information, and can develop their critical thinking skills to pick out the signal from the noise.\nClick enter at the bottom of this page to begin. First you'll need to interview an AI version of Andrew to understand the challenges journalists at world-leading publications like the FT face. Then you'll need to come up with an idea to help tackle one or more of these challenges, build it, and pitch it to Andrew!",

As explained within the challenge below, you'll need to clone our repo, push it to your own (public) repo on Github and add some new content, while fixing up some existing issues.\nPlease note, you can't yet resubmit your work - this feature is coming soon... so make sure you get it right first time!",

Make a fork of the Air Pollution Information repo: Clone it from https://github.com/InversityTech/AirPollutionInfo then create your own (public) Github repo for the challenge and push the cloned repo your own Github repo by changing the origin url.,2. Reset the head of the main branch back to the “v1” tag: The most recent commit on the main branch (after the v1 tag) is no longer needed as the ASCII art it added looks awful on GitHub’s README displayer., 3. Create a feature branch titled 'feature/interesting-stat': This should branch off from the “v1” tag on the main branch., 4. Add an interesting stat about air pollution: Add this to the README on your new feature branch at the bottom under the heading 'Interesting Stat'. Commit this change to the repo on your feature branch with a sensible commit message., 5. Clear up the repo with a .gitignore: Doh! You’ve just noticed that someone in Inversity has left their SSH key in the repo somehow. Remove the file ‘id_rsa’ from the repo and create a .gitignore file that will stop files with the same name being added in future. Wrap up your changes as another commit on the “feature/interesting-stat” branch (we are keeping it on the same branch here for simplicity), 6. Merge in another feature branch: It looks like one of the Inversity devs has created another feature branch called “feature/crazy-facts” but it hasn’t been updated in a while. Merge the “feature/crazy-facts” branch into your own “feature/interesting-stat” branch and resolve any merge conflicts so that you should now have the “Crazy facts” and “Interesting stats” sections at the bottom of the README in that order., 7. Raise a Pull Request: Create a Pull Request on your own Github repo to merge the “feature/interesting-stats” branch with all the above changes back into the “main” branch. Make sure to provide a good description of the scope of the changes. Leave the pull request open for the Inversity marking team to have a look at., 8. Link your repo: Enter the link to your github code repo below - make sure the repo is made public so we can view it., 9. Submit it!: Click submit and we'll get back to you with a mark and feedback as soon as we can",

            "instructions_steps": "1. Download the data: Download a CSV file with the raw hourly air quality data from https://inversitychallengedata.blob.core.windows.net/fullstackwebdevstage3/UK_air_quality_data_2022.csv,2. Build a Data Explorer program: Your program should read data from the CSV file and then listen for and respond to the following user inputs on the command line with the relevant output...,2a. Respond to user command “locations”: The program should print to the console a list of locations present in the dataset ordered from highest mean “nox” value to lowest mean “nox” value,2b. Respond to user command “information <location name>”: The program should print to the console the overall mean and the highest and lowest “nox” values for the location (these represent levels of nitrogen oxides present - which contribute to smog and acid rain). Additionally the overall mean and the highest and lowest “pm10” values should be printed for the location but *only* if at least 10% of the data points for the location contained “pm10” readings (these values relate to potentially harmful inhalable particulates). If an optional “--save <file path>” flag is passed on the end of the command (ie “information <location name> --save <file path>”) the output text that was printed should also be saved to provided file path as a text file.,2c. Respond to user command “vizualize <location name>”: The program should display a line graph of monthly mean “nox” levels for the location. This should be done using a suitable Python graphing package such as MatPlotLib - you may find it useful to also use a data science library such as Pandas to help with getting your data into the right format. If an optional “--save <file path>” flag is passed on the end of the command (ie “visualize <location name> --save <file path>” the graph should also be saved to the provided file path as an image file.,3. Implement Object Orientated design: Your program should make use of Object-Orientated design principles including the use of classes and inheritence. Not only is this important for ensuring the maintainability and extensibility of your code for future challenges but (just as importantly) it also allows you to demonstrate that you have mastered these important concepts in Python!,3a. The Location class: Your program should include a MonitoringLocation class - capable of taking a set of CSV rows corresponding to a particular monitoring site and translating this into key values such as the mean and the highest and lowest levels.,3b. The MonitoringLocationDisplayer class: The program should also contain a MonitoringLocationDisplayer class which takes a MonitoringLocation as input and handles the logic to display details about it and save those details to file. This class should contain a “display” method that writes the MonitoringLocation’s key data to stdout in the format required by the “information <location name>” user input and a “save” method that writes the above data to file.,3c. The VisualMonitoringLocationDisplayer class: You should create a subclass of MonitoringLocationDisplayer called VisualMonitoringLocationDisplayer to handle the “visualize” user input option. This should override the “display” and “save” methods of MonitoringLocationDisplayer to display a visual graph of the key location data and save that graph to file as an image respectively.,4. Check error handling: The program should contain sensible error handling with use of try/catch blocks to cope with unexpected errors - for example invalid user inputs and “NA” values in the dataset.,5. Check documentation: The program should be well explained via comments - including docstrings for functions. If external packages have been used these should be listed in a “requirements.txt” file,6. Link your repo: When your data explorer application is working and meets the above requirements - enter the link to your github code repo below. Make sure the repo is made public so we can view it.,7. Submit it!: Click submit and we'll get back to you with a mark and feedback as soon as we can",
